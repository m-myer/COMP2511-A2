                                <h3>Keep a calendar</h3>
                                <p>Create your own calendar, physical or digital, where you can enter all of your
                                    schduled
                                    class times, due dates for asignments and exams, and schedule in blocks of study
                                    time.
                                    Set yourself up
                                    for success! By scheduling in every course milestone, you already have an idea of
                                    direction the course
                                    material is headed, and you can stay on track throughout the semester. By scheduling
                                    in
                                    study time, you
                                    can develop a routine so that studying happens naturally and you can hold yourself
                                    more
                                    accountable in
                                    getting your work done.

                                <h3>Don't Forget to Take Breaks (but Don't get Carried Away)</h3>
                                <p>Taking 5 - 10 minute breaks during a study session
                                    is a great way to stay on task for longer periods of time without becoming mentally
                                    exhausted. Taking a
                                    short walk, stretching, even a short meditation can actually help you to be more
                                    focused
                                    when you return,
                                    just make sure that break time isn't suddenly stretching over 2 hours.

                                <p>Join or even start a study group with classmates. Collaborating with other people is
                                    a great way to see things from new perspectives. Study groups can help keep each
                                    other
                                    accountable
                                    during group study sessions and remind each other of upcoming due dates to stay on
                                    track.

                                <p>Keeping digital notes is great if you have a laptop or
                                    some other device you can take to class, but writing out a second set of handwritten
                                    notes is an excellent
                                    way to reprocess information that may have been delivered quickly during a lecture
                                    and
                                    reorganizating the
                                    information in a way that makes better sense for you. Feel free to get creative! Add
                                    colour using
                                    highlighters, make a deck of cue cards, create diagrams; find the best way for you
                                    to
                                    digest the information.

                                <p>It's easy to lose yourself in the study grind, but don't forget to put
                                    aside time for your personal life. Burnout is very real, and while it may seem
                                    counter-productive to take
                                    time for yourself, you'll come back refreshed and renergized!

                                    friends. Planning ahead is going to be one of the best ways to make sure that you
                                    have
                                    time set aside from
                                    your schoolwork for whatever you need.

                                    Make sure you are consistenly checking in with yourself and addressing any excessive
                                    anxiety or negative
                                    thoughts. Identifying a problem is always the first step in resolving anything.
